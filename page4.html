        <p>People were outraged. Just six months after the death of Brian White, approximately 1.2 million people were showing symptoms of Brain Corruption and an additional 400,000 had died. People stormed the Cyber building. Outraged that this had been allowed to happen with seemingly no regard. People called for Block to be imprisioned. In June of 2035, Evan Block removed himself from the company and was charged with genocide. In the proceeding trials, it had been discovered that the lack of warning of Brain Corruption had not come from lack of testing. Leaked company documents showed that Cyber executives had known the possibilites of long term exposure to the CyberVerse but had turned the other way to release a product to increase profits. Block and five other Cyber executives were found guilty and are serving multiple life sentences.</p>
        <p>Following the convictions, there was a growing public pressure on government to ban Cyber's virtual reality technologies. Multiple bills were written. However following the massive decline in population also meant that several holes had been created in world governments, and thus, no such legislation will ever be passed.</p>
