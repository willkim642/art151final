        <p>However three years into the CyberVerse, the illusion was beginning to fade, and the terrifying reality was beginning to show itself. 
        As it turns out, Cyber had not performed any long term tests before release to figure out what kind of effects digital conscience transference had on the body. In addition to the increase in sedentary lifestyles, it was revealed in a scientific journal that over time, digital conscience tranference was actually slowly eradicating the brains of those who were using the CyberVerse in what is now known as "Brain Corruption".</p>
        <p>The first recorded victim of Brain Corruption was Brian White. He had been an early adopter of the CyberVerse, even obtaining a Cyber headset early via the black market. Brian's family began to notice a noticable decline in Brian's cognition. It had started with him being unable to remember things that had just happened, then his personality became more numb to the world around him. He was hospitalized on April 12th, 2035 after he was found aimlessly roaming the streets. It was at the hospital where Brian began experiencing sudden total organ failure. Brian was 19 years old.</p>
